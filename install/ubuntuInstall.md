# Ubuntu installation

To set up your own computer for today's session, follow these instructions.
Copying and pasting the given code may be the easiest way to make sure everything works.

1. Open a Terminal and enter these lines one at a time. Enter `y` where required.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install fastqc
sudo apt-get install bwa
sudo apt-get install samtools
sudo apt-get install igv
sudo apt-get install picard-tools
```

- To install `bamtools` we need to clone the software `git`, then use `cmake` & `make`.
(The following can be copied and pasted as a single command.)

```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools
cd bamtools
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

- To install `bcftools` we also need to clone two git repos before the install.

```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone git://github.com/samtools/htslib.git
git clone git://github.com/samtools/bcftools.git
cd bcftools
make
sudo make install
```

- We'll also use `sabre` for demultiplexing

```
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/najoshi/sabre.git
cd sabre
sudo make
echo 'export PATH="/opt/sabre:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- Next we'll need to install `freebayes` which we'll use later for variant calling

```
git clone --recursive git://github.com/ekg/freebayes.git
cd freebayes
make
```

Finally, to install cutadapt, we need to use the `pip` installer instead of `apt-get`

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv
sudo pip install --upgrade cutadapt
```
